## The SignWriting Script (Sgnw)
SignWriting is an international standard for writing sign languages by hand or with computers.
From education to research, from entertainment to religion, SignWriting has proven useful because people are using it to write signed languages

Initially developed in 1974, the script was written exclusively by hand for 12 years.
Since then the script has spread around the world and continues to be written on paper and chalkboard.

In 1981, SignWriting Publishing rapidly evolved with Block Printing.
In 1986, computerization of the SignWriting Block Printing began.
The current symbol encoding of the International SignWriting Alphabet 2010 (ISWA 2010) has been stable since the font release on October 20th, 2010.

The larger script encoding model has been stable since the initial release of [Modern SignWriting](https://github.com/slevinski/msw) on January 12th, 2012.

The 2 families of the SignWriting Script are Handwriting for the writer and Block Printing for the reader.
Block Printing uses more features and Handwriting often uses less.
Block printing is used in education, publishing, and is the basis of the computerized model.
